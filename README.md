# Online-law-Portal
In today’s society, the biggest hurdle is that the people are not aware about their rights and legal remedies available for them. Most people are unaware of the laws implemented by the government. It is also very essential that the judiciary of any country should be an integral part of the society and its interactions with the society must be made regular and relevant. The project entitled as “Online Law Portal” aims to make the citizen aware about the kind of laws available under the constitution. An individual can login to the web site and get to see all the laws of IPC. The contacts of the lawyers are also available. Even individual can register a case online which is directly sent to the court authority. Web site is also responsible to keep a track of all the crimes happening, judgment of the court for various hearing and its updates.
